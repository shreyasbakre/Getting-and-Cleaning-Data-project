## Activity Labels
* [WALKING](VALUE 1):subject was walking during the test
* [WALKING_UPSTAIRS](VALUE 2):subject was walking up a staircase during the test
* [WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS](VALUE 3):subject was walking down a staircase during the test
* [SITTING](VALUE 4):subject was sitting during the test
* [STANDING](VALUE 5):subject was standing during the test
* [LAYING](VALUE 6):subject was laying down during the test

## Work performed to clean data
* [Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.]
* [Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.]
* [Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.]
* [Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.]
* [From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.]
